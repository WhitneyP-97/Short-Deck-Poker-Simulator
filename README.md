Simulator for short deck poker

This is a simulator for short deck poker.

There is a simulator for determining the approximate odds of an event (ie straight flush) happening, and there is also another simulator in the works for determining the chances of a preflop hand winning against another hand (or set of hands).

I also plan on making an app where you can play poker vs computer opponents to test out new strategies for the short deck.

This app accommodates short deck settings from 2 min (normal deck) to 10 min (broadways only), and you can/will be able to simulate/play using those settings.
